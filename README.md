# underscorets

A **dependency-less** utility library for modern TypeScript that can run on the edge. **Fully-tested** and ready to be dropped into any environment. **Tree-shakeable** so it doesn't bloat your projects with unnecessary imports. Similar functions to lodash except it is type-safe and optimized for modern JS environments.
